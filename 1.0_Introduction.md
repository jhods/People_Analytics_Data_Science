# Introduction: Who is this for, what will you get out of this, and why am I writing this?

#### Who is this for?
Have you spent hours on Stack Overflow or endlessly googling how to run your code?  Are most of those solutions in a completely different context than the People Analytics space, leaving you unsure if the nuances of the solution will be a problem? Are you often left wondering if the solution will work, since the example doesn’t actually explain the solution?  If you say yes to any of these questions, you’re in the right place!  There is a notable lack of relevant content in using data science in the People Analytics space, so my hope is to provide relevant examples in various data science topics being applied to HR data.

HR Analytics professionals looking to leverage more advanced analytics techniques in their work will get the most out of all this guidance.  You don’t need to be a Data Scientist or coder to leverage this content.  I’ll be thoroughly explaining the code, and providing explanation on what the code is doing.  If you have some familiarity with writing code (e.g. R, SQL, Python, VBA, etc) it will be helpful, but it isn’t required.  

Individuals who are new to the HR Analytics space can use this as a reference for some of the starting points for using analytics in the HR space.  

HR leaders searching to implement analytics techniques in the People Analytics space will also benefit from these materials.  The comments in the chapters will provide significant detail to understand the business problem and how it can be best solved with the analytics solution.  The good news is, you don’t need coding experience to leverage this content to understand what is possible.  In my experience, the most effective People Analytics leaders understand what methods and options are out there.  Understanding the possibilities is key, and it is not required that leaders themselves understand the intricacies of the code themselves. 

Finally, Data Scientists will find the most value in the use cases rather than the code itself. The use cases can be generalized to provide a more user-friendly initial framework to build on.

#### Who is this not for?
Anyone can benefit from this content, but People Analytics professionals already doing machine learning and text analytics will likely benefit the least.  The content is intentionally generalized to provide a framework to build off of.  If you’re already utilizing these techniques, it is likely you have already built out code that is more specific to your company’s data and use cases.

## What will you get from this book?
I’ll be developing this book in an iterative way, so you’ll see continuous updates.  As part of the MVP (minimum viable product), I’ll be including the following:
* *Introduction:* Overview of who it is intended for, what you’ll get from it, and why I am writing this book.
* *Getting Started:* What you need to get started if you don’t already have a setup for utilizing Python. Sometimes this can be frustrating. I recommend using Anaconda, which should be as simple as downloading the free software.
* *Predicting Turnover:* A framework for how to set up a model that will predict the risk of turnover.  We’ll go over a handful of approaches and my perspective on the pros and cons of each approach.
* *Text Analytics:* Text Analytics or NLP (Natural Language Processing) is the #1 area of opportunity for HR to better utilize analytics.  HR sits on a gold mine of text data (e.g. performance reviews, feedback from other employees, employee listening campaigns (corporate speak for surveys), job profiles, etc).  We’ll go through the basic framework, converting paragraphs of text to data we can gain meaning from.

There will be code you can apply to your own work in these sections.  This code is intended to be used as a basis to apply to the data at your company.  Each company will capture different information about its employees or execute different employee listening strategies, but the basics of this code can be taken and applied to your own data.  From there, and based on your company's needs, you can add and improve upon the code!

For future chapters, I’ll start by working on additional content that users are requesting.

## Why am I writing this?
When I started writing this book for using introductory data science techniques in the People Analytics (fancy name for HR Analytics) space, I had just finished my Master’s degree.  Following, I found myself with a lot of extra time.  I wrote this book to fill that free time, and to share my knowledge and experiences with others who will benefit from this content. 

Scott Galloway, a Marketing Professor at NYU and author, has a framework he recommends for people to utilize when trying to determine what to pursue.  He recommends that you search for the intersection between something you might be good at, something that doesn’t suck, and something people will pay you to do.  If you haven’t heard of Scott Galloway, I recommend reading his books.  Beyond his success as an author and professor, he does a number of interviews, podcasts, and speaking engagements.  Here is a link to his Tweet about the intersection described above to give you a place to start: https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1216744676360904706.  

#### Something you might be good at
The People Analytics space is an immature space, so the bar for “good” is set lower than other more mature fields in the advanced analytic realm.  I’ve been fortunate to work with a lot of great Data Scientists ranging from PhDs in Physics to converted Actuaries.  This experience, combined with my formal education has provided me the technical knowledge to apply Data Science techniques to HR data.

From my own experience, both reading articles and talking with various HR professionals about the adoption of People Analytics, there is often a significant gap between the person/team doing the analytics and the business facing employee (often an HR Business Partner).  As a People Analytics professional, if you find yourself having to explain a GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) to an HR Business Partner, you may be likely to fail.  My career niche is tying the analytics solution to the business problem, and I have both confidence and expertise in this area.  Throughout this book I will emphasize the “why” to help equip you with the necessary information to translate the often complex solution into a user friendly explanation for your client.

#### Something that doesn't suck (something you enjoy)
For me, this is fun.  I love the challenges that come with finding the best analytics solution for the business problem at hand.  In the People Analytics space, the general analytics challenges are compounded by the immaturity of the People Analytics space.  When speaking with a Director of HR Analytics for a subsidiary of a large international company, she indicated the subsidiary’s CEO had deemed utilizing analytics in the HR space a top priority. Yet, the subsidiaries HR Business Partners actively rejected using analytics in their decision making processes.  Though frustrating at times, this challenge allows me to determine the “right way” or the “best way” to do something, rather than focusing on the implementation of a solution someone else came up with.

#### Something people will pay you to do
The irony of writing a free book on GitHub…

All joking aside, I’ve done People Analytics work for two large companies and have been able to apply the concepts in this book in practice.  If nothing else, hopefully that provides some additional validity to what you’ll read in these pages!
