# Introduction: Who is this for, what will you get out of this, and why am I writing this?

## Who is this for and who is this not for?

#### Who is this for?
Have you spent hours on Stack Overflow or endlessly googling how to get your code to run?  Are most of those solutions in a completely different context than the People Analytics space and you’re unsure if the nuances of the solution will be a problem because the example doesn’t **actually** explain the solution?  You’re in the right place!

The HR Analytics professional that is looking to leverage more advanced analytics techniques in their work will get the most out of all this content.  You don’t need to be a Data Scientist or coder to leverage this content.  I’ll be thoroughly explaining the code, providing explanation on what the code is doing.  Having some familiarity with writing code, whether it be R, SQL, Python, VBA, etc. will be helpful but isn’t required.  There is a notable lack of relevant content in using data science in the People Analytics space, so my hope is to provide relevant examples in various data science topics being applied to HR data.

If you’re a leader in HR looking to know what is possible with the analytics techniques that can be leverage in the People Analytics space, this is also for you.  The comments in the chapters will provide significant detail to understand the business problem and how the business problem is being solved with the analytics solution, so you don’t need coding experience to leverage this content to understand what is possible.  In my experience, the most effective People Analytics leaders are the ones who are able to understand what methods or options are out there.  However, by no means should a leader’s expectation be to know how to actually do the analytics.

If you’re a Data Scientist, you’ll likely find the most value in the use cases rather than the code itself given it is generalized and reduces some of the nuances to provide a more user-friendly initial framework to build on.

#### Who is this not for?
Anyone will likely get some value from this content, however the that will likely get the least out of this content are the People Analytics professionals already doing machine learning and text analytics.  The content is intentionally generalized to provide a framework to build off of.  If you’re already utilizing these techniques, it is likely you already have some or most of this code built out that is more specific to your company’s data and use cases.

## What will you get from this book?
I’ll be developing this book in an iterative way, so you’ll see this section continue to update.  As part of the MVP (minimum viable product), I’ll be including the following:
* *Introduction:* Overview of who it is intended for, what you’ll get from it, and why I am writing this book.
* *Getting Started:* What you need to get started if you don’t already have a setup for utilizing Python. Sometimes this can get a big frustrating, but I’m directing you to Anaconda, which should be as simple as downloading the free software.
* *Predicting Turnover:* A framework for how to set up a model that will predict the risk of turnover.  We’ll go over a handful of approaches and my perspective on the pros and cons of each approach.
* *Text Analytics:* Text Analytics or NLP (Natural Language Processing) is the #1 area of opportunity for HR to better utilize analytics.  HR sits on a gold mine of text data: performance reviews, feedback from other employees, employee listening campaigns (corporate speak for surveys), job profiles, etc.  We’ll go through the basic framework for what needs to be done to go from paragraphs of text to something we can gain meaning from.

You'll get a lot of code you can apply to your own work in these sections.  Consider this code a starting place to apply to the data at your company.  Each company will capture different information about its employees or execute different employee listening strategies, but the basics of this code can be taken and applied to your own data.  From there based on your company's needs, you can add and improve upon the code from there!

For future chapters, I’ll start by working on enhancements that users recommend.

## Why am I writing this?
When I started writing this book for using introductory data science techniques in the People Analytics (fancy name for HR Analytics) space, I had just finished my Master’s degree and found myself with a lot of extra time.  Using this as an outlet to fill my new found free time in a meaningful way.

Scott Galloway has a framework he recommends for people to utilize when trying to determine what to pursue.  Find the intersection between something you might be good at, something that doesn’t suck, and something people will pay you to do.  If you haven’t heard of Scott Galloway, I recommend reading his books at a minimum.  Beyond being an author, he does a number of interviews, podcasts, speaking engagements, etc.  Here is a link to his Tweet about the intersection described above to give you a place to start: https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1216744676360904706.  

#### Something you might be good at
The People Analytics space is an immature space, so I have the fortune of the bar for “good” being set lower than other more mature fields in the advanced analytic realm.  I’ve been given the opportunity to work with a lot of great Data Scientists ranging from PhD’s in Physics to converted Actuaries.  The experience I have gained from working with them, combined with my formal education has provided me the technical knowledge to apply Data Science techniques on the HR data.

From my own experience, reading articles, talking with various HR professionals about the adoption of People Analytics, there is often a significant gap between the person/team doing the analytics and the business facing employee (often an HR Business Partner).  As a People Analytics professional, if you find yourself having to explain a GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) to an HR Business Partner, you’re significantly less likely to succeed in getting your point across.  My career niche (and something I do better than most) is tying the analytics solution to the business problem.  You’ll see throughout this book that I will emphasize the purpose and “why” to help equip you with the necessary information to translate the often complex solution into a user friendly explanation for your client.

#### Something that doesn't suck (something you enjoy)
You could also view this as “something you enjoy”.  For me, I love the challenges that come with finding the best analytics solution for the business problem at hand.  In the People Analytics space, the general analytics challenges are compounded by the immaturity of the People Analytics space.  When speaking with a Director of HR Analytics for a subsidiary of a large international company, she indicated the subsidiary’s CEO had deemed utilizing analytics in the HR space a top priority but the subsidiaries HR Business Partners actively reject using analytics in their decision making processes.  While it can be frustrating at times, I enjoy the challenge of taking on something where the “right way” hasn’t already been determined, because that means I get to help determine the “right way”!

Beyond the People Analytics space, something I enjoy is teaching others.  Its something that I get a lot of enjoyment out of, as I find it a means of giving back to others who have helped me get to where I am at today.  While often a cliche, I find myself understanding concepts or my own code better when I have to explain it to someone else.

#### Something people will pay you to do
The irony of writing a free book on GitHub…

All joking aside, I’ve done People Analytic work for 2 large companies and have been able to apply the concepts in this book in practice.  If nothing else, hopefully that provides some additional validity to what you’ll read in these pages!
