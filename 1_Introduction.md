# Introduction: Why am I writing this and who is this for?

## Why am I writing this?
When I started writing this book/tutorial/framework for using introductory Data Science techniques in the People Analytics (fancy name for HR Analytics), I had just finished my Master’s degree and found myself with a lot of extra time.
Scott Galloway has a framework he recommends for people to utilize when trying to determine what to pursue.  Find the intersection between something you might be good at, something that doesn’t suck, and something people will pay you to do.  If you haven’t heard of Scott Galloway, I recommend reading his books at a minimum.  Here is a link to his Tweet about the intersection described above to give you a place to start: https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1216744676360904706

#### Something you might be good at
The People Analytics space is an immature space, so I have the fortune of the bar for “good” being set lower than other more mature fields in the advanced analytic realm.  I’ve been given the opportunity to work with a lot of great Data Scientists ranging from PhD’s in Physics to converted Actuaries.  The experience I have gained from working with them, combined with my formal education has provided me the technical knowledge to apply Data Science techniques on the HR data.
From my own experience, reading articles, talking with various HR professionals about the adoption of People Analytics, there is often a significant gap between the person/team doing the analytics and the business facing employee (often times an HR Business Partner).  As an People Analytics professional, if you find yourself having to explain a GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) to an HR Business Partner, you’re significantly less likely to succeed in getting your point across.  My career niche and something I do better than most is tying the analytics solution to the business problem.  You’ll see throughout this book that I will emphasize the purpose and “why” to help equip you with that answer.
