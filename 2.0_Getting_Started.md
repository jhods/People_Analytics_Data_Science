# Getting Started

The following chapters will leverage Python rather than R.  Before I give the justification for this decision, it is important to note that R is traditionally leveraged more in HR due to the Industrial/Organizational Psychology (I/O Psych) influence within most HR departments.  Most I/O Psych programs utilize R for doing statistics resulting in them often being the most technical employees within HR.

Let’s dig into why I’m choosing Python rather than R.  There are three primary reasons.  
1. The sklearn library in Python is superior to the modeling/data science packages available in R.  Especially when getting started, sklearn abstracts away a lot of the coding complexity.  It also has robust and inclusive documentation, making it easy to learn more about the functions being leveraged.  If you’re traditionally an R user, I think you’ll find the sklearn documentation easier to understand and follow compared to most documentation for R packages.
2. The packages for Natural Language Processing (NLP) are more robust in Python than in R.  Much of what you would need to start taking your survey comments into usable features can be done with just sklearn.  However, there are other packages like nltk that can be used to supplement sklearn.
3. There is simply a lack of Python examples in the People Analytics space.  This was a pain point for me, so I think it is fair the same can be said for others as well.

If you already use Python and your company has a preferred way of using Python, **use that and skip to the next chapter**.  If you haven’t used Python before, see the instructions for downloading Anaconda below.  If you’re doing this on a work computer and have some security restrictions on what you can download, please work with your IT department to find the best way to download what is required.

*Anaconda:* This is Anaconda’s [site](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda is the **preferred** solution as it downloads everything you need, including the Python language as well as the interfaces to make it easier to write and run Python code.  It is also free of charge as it is an open source software.  You will want to download the individual version [here]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  This is the software setup I used for the coding in this book.  I am using Python 3.7, but the specific version of Python or the libraries being utilized should not cause any issues.

We will utilize JupyterLab as our interface for writing and running our code.  Once you have downloaded Anaconda, search for the “Anaconda Navigator” in your applications and then open it.  This may take a bit of time, but once it is open click “launch” for the JupyterLab tile.  The JupyterLab interface will open in your web browser.  On the left hand side of your screen, you'll see your folder navigation.  Create a new folder and click into that folder. Now you’re ready to get started!
